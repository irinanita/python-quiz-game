# Python Quiz Game

This is going to be a quiz game in Python

## Tests
* When no radio button was selected the app crashed
Add the required attribute to the radio buttons, then it will not let the user proceed without selecting one. 
Code is crashing here option = request.form["option"]. If no "option" is selected, it is not included in the POST body, 
so request.form["option"] doesn't exist.
